Amoeba is going to be a free game similar to commercial games
like Worms or Snails. It is being developed under Pascal with
the ObjectPascal and Delphi/Kylix extensions using the open 
source freepascal compiler and the SDL4Freepascal libraries.
The primary target OS is x86/ppc linux, but ports to other
systems and platforms should be possible and are likely to
happen. 

At the moment, amoeba is in its early development stage; there
is nothing even remotely playable (yet). I'm currently developing
the neccesary libraries to provide graphics, input and physics
handling which are needed to create a working game engine
So, at this time, you can only compile the libraries and some
small demos (which test the various units classes and stuff).
For details how to do this see the INSTALL file.

Also, there isn't any real documentation yet, but expect this
to change in the future... :)

As this project (like most open source projects) is developed
in spare time, any help is welcome - especially for creating
graphics, as I am a lousy artist. Folks who have some experience 
with pascal/delphi/kylix coding are also welcome.

So, have fun with those little demo things and have patience if
you are waiting for the real game (or even better: contribute).

Amoeba is published under the GPL with exception to the contents
of the directory "headers" which are published under the LGPL.
