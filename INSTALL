In order to compile amoeba (demos), you need a working
FreePascal installation (fpc 2.0 works). In addition,
you need the SDL4Freepascal libraries and (of course)
SDL itself - you can get those at "sdl4fp.souceforge.net" 
and "www.libsdl.org". Also, you will need a working
SDL_ttf installation (version 2.0.6 works).

If everything is set up correctly, a simple "make" in the
amoeba top directory should do the job. If you want to
add any compiler options (or disable debugging output), you'll
have to edit the makefile manually.
In order to compile the demos, do "make demos".

This has only been tested on linux x86/ppc; if anyone tries
compiling on other platforms: please tell me your experience...


Things you might find after compilation (make demos):

/demos/graphdemo:
Tests the graphics subsystem displaying some nice blinking stars,
a swarm of flies (you can control them with the arrow keys;
space goes on to the next demo). In addition, if you copy
a small(!) bmp into the directory containing graphdemo, it will
perform various blitting tests and tell you the results.


P.S.: If graphics seem slow, you should try using the SDL
dga video driver ("export SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dga"); this
speeds up things tremendously (if it doesn't trash X11).
